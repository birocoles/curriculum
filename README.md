This repo contains my CV, as well as all tex files needed to create it
at the folder `files`.
The model used to create this CV is based on that presented by
[Ian Appelbaum at Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/ian-appelbaums-cv/xkcwsvxbrkyr#.We5E0XBrzCI).
The bibliographic style was created by using the
[`makebst`](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/custom-bib).
