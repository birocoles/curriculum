abstract = {We created a funnel-shaped magnetic body from magnetite powder dispersed in plaster and used a travelling 3-component fluxgate magnetometer to map the magnetic field at a low elevation above it. This provided a dataset with signal and noise characteristics similar to those of a field survey, but for a source much better known than any buried geological body. We then used this survey data and the known source details to evaluate recovery of that information from inversions with different degrees of freedom and constraint. This provides guidance in evaluation of inversion results from field data for which the source characteristics are unknown. We found that because of small imperfections in the data and model, the inversion result closest to the truth, although fitting the data quite acceptably, is not the model with the smallest data misfit. Chasing further reduction in data misfit in some cases leads to inversion results which better fit the data but which diverge from the known magnetization. Furthermore, inversions to fit the noise-free field forward computed from a digital version of the model do not recover that exact model, with increasing deviation (but smaller data misfits) as increasing complexity is added to the inversion models.},

abstract = {We present a comparison between the computing of gravity gradient tensor components from the vertical component of the gravitational attraction using the fast Fourier transform and the equivalent-layer techniques. In this comparison, we consider that the observed data consist of: (1) the residual gravity field (produced by local sources) and (2) the overlapping of regional and residual gravity fields. Applications to synthetic data show that the fast Fourier transform technique amplifies the noise to calculate the six components of the tensor. Comparing the FFT and the equivalent-layer results with the true gravity gradient components produced by local source without regional gravity field,the equivalent-layer result yields a better result because it shows a smaller residual. However, when the observed data have a regional gravity field overlapped to the residual gravity field both techniques yield unacceptable results,indicating the need of new methodologies to deal with regional field.},

We have conducted numerical simulations by computing the vertical component of the gravitational attraction exerted by a synthetic petroleum reservoir. Three parameters were tested regarded a detectability limit of 3 μGal: oceanic tides, reservoir depth and reservoir density changes simulating oil production. For this value, tides with a magnitude of few centimeters can affect the data, even at great distances from the measurement points. A 25 m thick reservoir could be detected even at 7 km depth. Differences in density could be detected after 20% of oil to salt water substitution in a reservoir at 3 km depth.},

abstract = { The interpretation of total-field anomalies data presents complexities due to dipolar characteristics of the anomalies. Usually, the geophysicists apply some transformations to the measured total-field anomaly to assist the magnetic interpretation and inversion. However, it can lead to an unstable transformed data at low latitude regions. To transform the total-field anomaly into the amplitude of the magnetic anomaly vector, we can use the equivalent layer technique and the Fourier filtering. These two methods are applied to synthetic magnetic data simulated at high-and low-magnetic latitudes. At high latitude, the computed amplitude of the magnetic anomaly vector either by applying the Fourier filtering or by employing the equivalent layer technique is equal to the true one. However, at low latitudes, the computed amplitude of the magnetic anomaly vector differs from the true one either by applying the Fourier filtering or by employing the equivalent layer technique. Both computed amplitudes of the magnetic anomaly vector exhibit striations in the direction of declination at low latitudes. However, at low latitudes, the magnitudes of the differences between the true and the computed amplitude of the magnetic anomaly vector produced by employing the equivalent layer technique are substantially smaller than the ones produced by applying the Fourier filtering. The better result produced by the equivalent layer technique is because the stabilization imposed by the Tikhonov regularization. We also applied the equivalent layer technique and the Fourier filtering to real total-field anomaly at a low latitude region encompassing the Central Amazonian Province and the Carajás Mineral Province, Brazil, aiming at computing the amplitude of the magnetic anomaly vector. Likewise, both transformations exhibit undesirable striations; however the one obtained via the equivalent layer technique yields better result in comparison with those obtained via the Fourier filtering.},

    abstract = { We present a method for inverting total-field anomaly data to estimate the geometry of a 3D geological source in the subsurface. The method assumes that both the magnetization vector and the depth to the top of the source are known. We use an ensemble of vertically juxtaposed 3D right prisms to approximate the shape of the geological source. Each prism has a known homogeneous magnetization and an unknown polygon as its horizontal cross-section. The vertices of the polygons approximate the horizontal depth slices of the source. The method estimates the horizontal coordinates of the vertices and the thickness of all prisms defining the interpretation model. The method is formulated in the space domain, as a constrained nonlinear inversion. Tests with synthetic and real total-field anomaly data show the efficiency of the method on retrieving the shape of the source and fitting the data.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Time: 3:30 PMLocation: 214DPresentation Type: Oral },

abstract = { We present an iterative cost-effective approach for computing the gravity-gradient tensor components from the gravity data (gz-component) using a fast equivalent-layer technique. Instead of solving linear systems and matrix multiplications, the method estimates the mass distribution on the equivalent layer through an iterative inversion algorithm. The 2D mass distribution is represented by a finite discrete set of point masses located directly below each observed data. The initial approximation is iteratively updated by adding a mass correction that is proportional to the residuals. Finally, the gravity-gradient tensor components are computed by multiplying the corresponding transformation matrix by the estimated mass distribution. Advantages of this method relative to the Fourier approach are it requires neither a regular grid nor an even observation surface. Tests on synthetic and real gravity data from the Vinton salt dome, USA, show that we must remove the regional gravity data first to calculate gravity-gradient tensor components with the equivalent-layer technique.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 8:30 AMPresentation Time: 11:00 AMLocation: 214DPresentation Type: Oral },

    abstract = { We propose a new method for estimating the total magnetization direction of magnetic sources based on the inversion of total-field anomaly via equivalent-layer technique. This technique is commonly used for processing magnetic data by estimating a magnetic-moment distribution over a planar layer of dipoles having an uniform magnetization direction. It can be shown that this distribution is all-positive if the magnetization direction of the dipoles is equal to that of the arbitrary magnetic sources producing the observed data. Based on this theoretical property, we propose an iterative algorithm to estimate the magnetization direction of 3D magnetic sources by imposing a positivity constraint on the magnetic-moment distribution of the dipoles forming the equivalent layer. Our approach imposes neither information on the shape nor on the depth of magnetic sources. Tests with synthetic data and field data, from an alkaline intrusion in southern Brazil, show that our method is able to correctly estimate the magnetization direction of the sources.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Time: 2:15 PMLocation: 214DPresentation Type: Oral },

    abstract = { We propose the use of the amplitude of the magnetic vector (B) for qualitative interpretation at low latitudes. The B is computed from transforming the total-field anomaly into the three orthogonal components in the x-, y-, and z-directions. The B generates a maximum over the source, allowing the definition of the horizontal projection of the source. We perform tests in synthetic data simulating a main geomagnetic field (main field) with vertical incidence and at low latitudes. The sources that give rise to the simulated anomalies have both induced and strong remanent magnetizations. The synthetic tests show that for defining the geologic sources’ horizontal projections the B performs better than the total gradient amplitude (TGA) of total-field anomaly. By comparing the maps of B and of the simulated gravity data, we show their good correlation, even for sources with negative density contrast. We applied both the B and the TGA to the real total-field anomaly from the Amazonian Craton, Brazil, and compared with Bouguer data. The result shows that the B can be a useful tool for qualitative interpretation at low latitudes and suggests studies to update the geologic knowledge.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Time: 4:20 PMLocation: 214DPresentation Type: Oral },
