    abstract = { We present a method for inverting total-field anomaly data to estimate the geometry of a 3D geological source in the subsurface. The method assumes that both the magnetization vector and the depth to the top of the source are known. We use an ensemble of vertically juxtaposed 3D right prisms to approximate the shape of the geological source. Each prism has a known homogeneous magnetization and an unknown polygon as its horizontal cross-section. The vertices of the polygons approximate the horizontal depth slices of the source. The method estimates the horizontal coordinates of the vertices and the thickness of all prisms defining the interpretation model. The method is formulated in the space domain, as a constrained nonlinear inversion. Tests with synthetic and real total-field anomaly data show the efficiency of the method on retrieving the shape of the source and fitting the data.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Time: 3:30 PMLocation: 214DPresentation Type: Oral },

    abstract = { We present an iterative cost-effective approach for computing the gravity-gradient tensor components from the gravity data (gz-component) using a fast equivalent-layer technique. Instead of solving linear systems and matrix multiplications, the method estimates the mass distribution on the equivalent layer through an iterative inversion algorithm. The 2D mass distribution is represented by a finite discrete set of point masses located directly below each observed data. The initial approximation is iteratively updated by adding a mass correction that is proportional to the residuals. Finally, the gravity-gradient tensor components are computed by multiplying the corresponding transformation matrix by the estimated mass distribution. Advantages of this method relative to the Fourier approach are it requires neither a regular grid nor an even observation surface. Tests on synthetic and real gravity data from the Vinton salt dome, USA, show that we must remove the regional gravity data first to calculate gravity-gradient tensor components with the equivalent-layer technique.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 8:30 AMPresentation Time: 11:00 AMLocation: 214DPresentation Type: Oral },

    abstract = { We propose a new method for estimating the total magnetization direction of magnetic sources based on the inversion of total-field anomaly via equivalent-layer technique. This technique is commonly used for processing magnetic data by estimating a magnetic-moment distribution over a planar layer of dipoles having an uniform magnetization direction. It can be shown that this distribution is all-positive if the magnetization direction of the dipoles is equal to that of the arbitrary magnetic sources producing the observed data. Based on this theoretical property, we propose an iterative algorithm to estimate the magnetization direction of 3D magnetic sources by imposing a positivity constraint on the magnetic-moment distribution of the dipoles forming the equivalent layer. Our approach imposes neither information on the shape nor on the depth of magnetic sources. Tests with synthetic data and field data, from an alkaline intrusion in southern Brazil, show that our method is able to correctly estimate the magnetization direction of the sources.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Time: 2:15 PMLocation: 214DPresentation Type: Oral },

    abstract = { We propose the use of the amplitude of the magnetic vector (B) for qualitative interpretation at low latitudes. The B is computed from transforming the total-field anomaly into the three orthogonal components in the x-, y-, and z-directions. The B generates a maximum over the source, allowing the definition of the horizontal projection of the source. We perform tests in synthetic data simulating a main geomagnetic field (main field) with vertical incidence and at low latitudes. The sources that give rise to the simulated anomalies have both induced and strong remanent magnetizations. The synthetic tests show that for defining the geologic sources’ horizontal projections the B performs better than the total gradient amplitude (TGA) of total-field anomaly. By comparing the maps of B and of the simulated gravity data, we show their good correlation, even for sources with negative density contrast. We applied both the B and the TGA to the real total-field anomaly from the Amazonian Craton, Brazil, and compared with Bouguer data. The result shows that the B can be a useful tool for qualitative interpretation at low latitudes and suggests studies to update the geologic knowledge.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Time: 4:20 PMLocation: 214DPresentation Type: Oral },
